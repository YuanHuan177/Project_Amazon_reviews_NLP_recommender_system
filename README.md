# Project_Amazon_reviews_NLP_recommender_system
Mining , pre-processing and embedding 650,000 Amazon Movie &amp; T.V. reviews to build a multi class Naive Bayes model to predict rating from text and interpreting the classifier using local surrogate models using the LIME library. Using LDA topic modeling to build a theme based recommender from the reviews and using a model based collaborative filtering system using SVD  matrix factorization to build a second recommender system.
